       "'Page: FCSB\\nSummary: Fotbal Club FCSB (Romanian pronunciation: [fet͡ʃeseˌbe]), commonly known as FCSB, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest. It has spent its entire history in the top flight of the Romanian league system, the Liga I.\\nThe original Steaua București football team was founded in 1947 and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence, through the namesake CSA Steaua București sports club. In 1998, the football department and its facilities were separated from the latter and taken over by a group of shareholders in a post-Ceaușescu privatisation scheme, allegedly leading to one of the shareholders acquiring full ownership five years later. However, CSA Steaua București has been in conflict with the football club since 2011, claiming that it was a new and separate entity; this resulted in multiple court cases and the forced change of the name from\\nFC Steaua București to  FC FCSB in early 2017.Domestically, when taken together with the disputed pre-2003 honours, the club has won the Liga I 26 times, Cupa României 24 times, Cupa Ligii two times, and Supercupa României six times—all competition records. Internationally, they have won the European Cup and European Super Cup, both in 1986. They reached the European Cup final once again in 1989, when they were defeated by AC Milan. Throughout their history, the Roș-albaștrii also played the final of the Intercontinental Cup, the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners\\' Cup and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup.\\nFCSB\\'s home ground is Arena Națională, having moved here from the Ministry of National Defence-owned Stadionul Ghencea. Initially, the club played in the colours of the Romanian tricolour, but the team became associated with the red and blue scheme after yellow soon lost its importance. Recently, some kits have begun reintegrating the latter colour.\\nThe club has a long-standing grudge against neighbouring Dinamo București, with matches between the two being commonly referred to as the \"Eternal derby\" or the \"Romanian derby\". Another notable rivalry is the one against Rapid București, while several milder ones are disputed against teams outside the capital, including a recent one against CFR Cluj that commenced because of the title race these teams fought in the last years.\\n\\nPage: CSA Steaua București (football)\\nSummary: Clubul Sportiv al Armatei Steaua București (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈste̯awa bukuˈreʃtʲ]), commonly known as Steaua București, or simply as Steaua, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest. It is one of the sporting sections of the namesake CSA Steaua București and competes in the Liga II.\\nIn 2017, the parent club reactivated its football section and entered it into the 2017–18 season of Liga IV, the fourth tier of the Romanian football league system. According to the club\\'s records and the latest Romanian court orders (July 2019 and June 2021) it is the most successful football club in Romania, with national records for winning the domestic trophies, plus the European Cup in 1986 and European Super Cup in 1987. However, ownership of the titles is disputed between two entities, with agencies such as UEFA and LPF attributing all of the original club history to the other club, FCSB.They play their home matches at the new Steaua Stadium. They used to play on Ghencea V between 2017 and 2021, one of the former training fields of the Complexul Sportiv Steaua, as the previous stadium, used by the historic Steaua entity during its heyday, was demolished in order for the current stadium to be built in the old one\\'s place. The team colours are red and blue.\\nThe club has a long-standing rivalry with neighbouring Dinamo București, with matches between the two being commonly referred to as \"the Eternal Derby\", \"the Romanian Derby\", or \"the Great Derby\".\\n\\n'"

      "Summary: In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. More sophisticated strategies are required to mitigate this type of attack; simply attempting to block a single source is insufficient as there are multiple sources.A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, thus disrupting trade and losing the business money.\n",

      "Summary: DDoS mitigation is a set of network management techniques and/or tools, for resisting or mitigating the impact of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on networks attached to the Internet, by protecting the target, and relay networks. DDoS attacks are a constant threat to businesses and organizations, by delaying service performance, or by shutting down a website entirely.DDoS mitigation works by identifying baseline conditions for network traffic by analyzing \"traffic patterns\", to allow threat detection and alerting. DDoS mitigation also requires identifying incoming traffic, to separate human traffic from human-like bots and hijacked web browsers. This process involves comparing signatures and examining different attributes of the traffic, including IP addresses, cookie variations, HTTP headers, and browser fingerprints.\n",
      "After the detection is made, the next process is filtering. Filtering can be done through anti-DDoS technology like connection tracking, IP reputation lists, deep packet inspection, blacklisting/whitelisting, or rate limiting.One technique is to pass network traffic addressed to a potential target network through high-capacity networks, with \"traffic scrubbing\" filters.Manual DDoS mitigation is no longer recommended, due to the size of attacks often outstripping the human resources available in many firms/organizations. Other methods to prevent DDoS attacks can be implemented, such as on-premises and/or cloud-based solution providers. On-premises mitigation technology (most commonly a hardware device) is often placed in front of the network. This would limit the maximum bandwidth available to what is provided by the Internet service provider. Common methods involve hybrid solutions, by combining on-premises filtering with cloud-based solutions.\n",
